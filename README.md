# 3D-Turtle-in-Python
I drew a cube in my first semester doing computer science at QUT

Shoutout to the cool teaching team at QUT who made learning python fun and were always interested in cool stuff we came up with.

I had previous experience doing 3D math etc. in C#/C++ from programming games at Southbank Insitute of Technology.
